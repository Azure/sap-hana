Contributing Guidelines
=======================

Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

This document summarizes the deployment principles which govern our project.

Building "in the Open"
----------------------
* Our users appreciate the transparency of our project; in this context, building "in the open" means that anyone can:
  * see the individual pull requests this solution is comprised of;
  * understand particular changes by going back and forth between pull requests;
  * submit pull requests with their own changes. 
* In addition, we use open-source software (OSS) tools rather than proprietrary technology to build the solution.

Fully Maintained
----------------
* Our project is not an as-is tool that may or may not work; instead we strive to:
  * continuously deploy it using an internal runner to ensure performance and stability;
  * detect regressions introduced by code changes before merging them.

Execution-focused
-----------------
* We don't just work on some grand plan that may or never be completely executed;
  * instead, we start building out the solution and iterate towards a grand plan.
