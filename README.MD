# Automated SAP Deployments in Azure Cloud <!-- omit in toc -->
Master Branch's status: [![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/azuresaphana/Azure-SAP-HANA/_apis/build/status/Azure.sap-hana.v2?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/azuresaphana/Azure-SAP-HANA/_build/latest?definitionId=6&branchName=master)

This repository contains code that can be used to automatically deploy SAP landscapes in the Azure Cloud.

The templates are split into:
- **Terraform modules**
which deploy the infrastructure components (such as VMs, network, storage) in Azure.
- **Ansible playbooks**
which run different roles to configure and VMs and install SAP HANA and required applications on the already deployed infrastructure.

## Usage

A typical deployment lifecycle will require the following steps:

Step 1) [**Preparing your environment**](/documentation/getting-started.md#preparing-your-environment) (this has to be done only once)

Step 2) [**Select Terraform Deployment Unit**](#terraform-deployment-units)

   *(**Note**: There are some script under [sap-hana/util](https://github.com/Azure/sap-hana/tree/master/util) would help if you are using Linux based workstation)*
