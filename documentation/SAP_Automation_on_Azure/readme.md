**SAP Automation on Azure**

Welcome to the [**SAP on Azure Deployment Automation Framework**](https://github.com/Azure/sap-hana/blob/documentation/v2.3/documentation/SAP_Automation_on_Azure/table_of_contents.md) repository. This repository contains code that will support the automated deployments of SAP platforms in the Azure Cloud.

This framework allows to deploy infrastructure for SAP landscapes based on SAP HANA and NetWeaver with AnyDB and related infrastructure. All SAP supported operating system versions are being supported by this framework as well. All SAP tiers – SBX, DEV, QA, PROD can be deployed in a chosen region.

**The deployment framework is based on Microsoft best practices and principles for SAP on Azure outlined in a comprehensive documentation which should be followed to ensure supportability by using certified virtual machine and storage solutions, stability, reliability and performance. [**Get started with SAP on Azure VMs - Azure Virtual Machines | Microsoft Docs**](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/get-started)

Principles of cloud adoption framework have been incorporated into the automation framework. [Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure - Cloud Adoption Framework | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/)
